Backslashes are not replaced with slashes,\n//    so `http:\\\\example.org\\` is treated like a relative path\n//\n// 3. Trailing colon is treated like a part of the path,\n//    i.e. in `http://example.org:foo` pathname is `:foo`\n//\n// 4. Nothing is URL-encoded in the resulting object,\n//    (in joyent/node some chars in auth and paths are encoded)\n//\n// 5. `url.parse()` does not have `parseQueryString` argument\n//\n// 6.
